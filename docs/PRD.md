**Aevoy** — Your AI Employee That Never Fails

**Tagline:** "If a human can do it on a computer, Aevoy can do it."

- Remembers everything forever (4 memory types)
- Works 24/7 without you
- Contacts YOU when needed (proactive engine)
- Never gives up — 15+ fallback methods for every action
- Verifies its own work (3-step verification)
- Can control your computer directly (desktop mode)
